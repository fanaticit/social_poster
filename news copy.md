Take on Riftcharged Monsters With New Feature: Base Defense!
Starting in Season 8, the final week of each Wave (month-long exploration period) at exploration bases will culminate in a Base Defense event, where you and nearby hunters will face off against powerful riftcharged monsters.
These monsters have been heavily influenced by abnormal rifts and cannot be slain in a single hunt. You’ll need to team up with other hunters in your area and challenge them multiple times!

About Riftcharged Monster Hunts

The damage you deal to a riftcharged monster is recorded as Defense Points (tracked individually).
Defense Points are tallied for each weapon you’ve used, and your top 5 weapon scores determine the Defense Rewards you’ll earn.
Tips for Earning More Points
You can use any weapon in these hunts, but if you equip a featured defense weapon for that Wave, you’ll receive bonus Defense Points.

What Are Featured Defense Weapons?
Featured defense weapons change with each Wave. They include weapons forged from specific monsters’ materials or event-exclusive weapons.

(Example) Season 8 Wave 1 featured defense weapons:

Weapons forged mainly from Astalos materials
Weapons forged mainly from Khezu materials
Wrapping Bow, the exclusive weapon from the A Happy Hunting New Year 2026 event
Forge and upgrade a variety of weapons to face the riftcharged monster!

Stay tuned for more details in an upcoming announcement.

Exchange Certain Gatherable and Small Monster Materials for Gems
If you’re missing some materials needed to forge or upgrade equipment, you’ll soon be able to exchange gems to complete the process.
Use this option when you’re short on gatherable materials or small monster materials.

The following material types will be eligible:

Iron Ore / Monster Bone S / Fire Herb / Flowfern / Snow Herb / Sleep Herb / Dragonfell Berry / Parashroom / Toadstool / Nitroshroom / Thunderbug / Godbug / Sharp Claw / Wingdrake Hide
This feature will be introduced in an upcoming update ahead of the Season 8 release.

Once Season 8 begins, you will no longer be able to raise your Season 7 tier but you will still be able to claim any rewards for a period of time.
