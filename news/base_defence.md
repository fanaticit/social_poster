Update From the Developers: New Base Defense Feature is Coming!
New Feature
Producer Letter
Update

Hey hunters!
This is the Monster Hunter Now Development Team.

Starting with the upcoming Season 8, a new feature called Base Defense will debut, allowing hunters gathered at the same exploration base to work together and take on riftcharged monsters. These monsters are far more powerful than usual!

Prepare your equipment and take on the riftcharged monster that appears at exploration bases during the final week of each Wave (month-long exploration period). Are you up for the challenge?

Overview of Base Defense

Overview

Base Defense is a feature where hunters gathered at the same exploration base cooperate to challenge riftcharged monsters, which are significantly more powerful than regular monsters.
Requirements

Hunter Rank (HR) 11 or higher
An exploration base must be nearby
Base Defense can be joined from outside the access range, just like accessing the exploration base menu.
How to Play

During specific times in the final week of each Wave, a riftcharged monster will appear at each exploration base.
The damage you deal to a riftcharged monster is recorded as Defense Points (tracked individually).
Defense Points are tallied for each weapon you used, and your Defense Rewards are based on the combined points of your top 5 weapons.
Tips for Earning More Points

You can challenge riftcharged monsters with any weapon, but using the featured defense weapon for that Wave grants a bonus to the Defense Points you earn.
Prepare your equipment and upgrade before the riftcharged monster appears in the final week!
Take on Riftcharged Monsters!

Riftcharged monsters are heavily affected by the influence of abnormal rifts, making them much stronger than usual. Unlike normal monsters, they cannot be slain in a single hunt. Work together with nearby hunters and challenge them repeatedly to push them back.

What Is the Dimensional Barrier?
Riftcharged monsters are surrounded by a dimensional barrier, powered by the influence of abnormal rifts. While the barrier is active, damage dealt is greatly reduced, but landing continuous attacks temporarily weakens the barrier, allowing you to deal more damage. Don’t miss the opening, and keep attacking aggressively!

After a Base Defense
Any hunter who participates in at least one Base Defense during the Wave will receive an Urgent Quest to slay the riftcharged monster at the end of the Wave. After fighting together in Base Defense, take on the final showdown in the Urgent Quest!

Try the Featured Defense Weapons!

You can challenge riftcharged monsters with any weapon, but using a featured defense weapon grants bonus Defense Points. Upgrade these weapons to prepare for the challenge ahead!

What Are Featured Defense Weapons?
The featured defense weapons change each Wave.
Weapons forged from certain monsters, as well as event-exclusive weapons, may be selected.

We don't know a lot about this new Base Defence feature but we do know a few things. 

I'm going to answer some of the questions you might have on your mind.

1. "Do I really need to upgrade 5 different weapons to get maximum rewards?"
Ideally, yes. To get the maximum possible "Defense Rewards," you need to post a high score with 5 different weapons. The game tracks your "Defense Points" (damage dealt) for every weapon you use. Your final score is the sum of your best runs from your top 5 distinct weapons. Base Defences is a way for the game to push you into making a few more weapons than just one of each type and not changing. Spend some of that zenny and make different weapons just because they look cool, not just because they are the highest DPS. If you only use one "main" weapon, you will only fill 1 out of the 5 scoring slots. To maximize rewards, you should try to have at least 4 other serviceable weapons (even if they are slightly weaker) to fill those slots.

2. "Is it better to use a 'Featured Weapon' or my strongest Grade 10 weapon?"
The text says using featured weapons "grants a bonus to the Defense Points," but you can challenge it with any weapon. Why they will ask: Players will want to know the math. If the bonus is small, they might prefer using their maxed-out Black Diablos Bow (for example) rather than crafting a new Khezu weapon just for this event. They need to know if raw damage outweighs the point bonus.

3. "Can we actually kill the Riftcharged Monster during the Base Defense?"
"Unlike normal monsters, they cannot be slain in a single hunt." During the Base Defense week, you fight the monster in instances. You "defeat" it (reduce HP to zero or time out) to earn Hunt Rewards and Exchangeable Materials per run. The monster, however, does not stay dead.
You only get to truly "Slay" the Riftcharged monster in the Urgent Quest that unlocks after the Base Defense wave ends.

4. "How exactly does the 'Dimensional Barrier' work—is it based on damage or hit count?"
The text mentions that "landing continuous attacks temporarily weakens the barrier." The barrier grants the monster massive damage reduction. It is not broken by one big hit, so weapons that hit frequently (Dual Blades, Bow, Light Bowgun, Sword & Shield) or aggressive playstyles are best at lowering the barrier. The barrier regenerates after a set time, so you must keep the pressure up. Featured Weapons deplete this barrier significantly faster.

5. "What are 'Exchangeable Materials' and can I get Wyvern Gem Shards?"
These are special event tokens/currencies you drop from Riftcharged monsters during Base Defense hunts. You take these materials to the "Base Defense Exchange Hub" to swap them for valuable items. The confirmed list includes Wyvern Gem Shards (WGS), Wyvern Scarcestone, and other monster materials. This makes Base Defense one of the best ways to farm WGS without relying purely on RNG drops.
