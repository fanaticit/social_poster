Check the FAQ, which will be published on the day of the event, for more details.


The main purpose of this quest is to have all Hunt-a-thons be Astalos. This with the normal reset timer of 3 hours. You can pick which day you want the ticket for as well.
There is also the standard bonuses of:
- Expanded access range
- Double materials from slaying small monsters and from gathering points
- Limited time quest
Also buy it through the webstore for some extra storage I'm sure.

If this is the standard £3.99 I don't think it's going to be worth it. I think there will be enough of Astalos around to build the weapons and armor without the Hunt-a-thon boost of 5 hunts every now and again.

Don't buy this ticket, it's not worth it. This only unlocks Astalos hunts and the standard ticket bonuses of expanded range, double materials from small monsters and a event quest. It's not worth the £3.99 each day.
I did think that the £3.99 would be for all 5 days but that was just the word unlimited before you get to each day price.
There are enough Astalos around but I have noticed in the past that the frequency of the monster decreses over the days so maybe if you have not hunted enough on the last few days you might want your hunt-a-thons to only be Astalos hunts.
The only other point I see to buying the ticket is if you are low on those small monster parts and gathering materials. This does really boost those in your storage, so if you are struggeling to build max level weapons and armor because of parts then buy a day and forrige.
