Riftcharged Monster!
Riftcharged monsters are here! But what else is happening this week?

It's called the Upgrade rush quest

The upgrade rush's aim is to boost your zenny and let you do those final upgrades for the base defense. Thank you.

You can find Shining Eggs while hunting. These aren't for omelets—trade them in for massive stacks of Zenny! Check if you have some from other events?

Need Astalos plates? The limited-time quests are handing out 50 scales, shells, and even plates just for clearing them.

Monster Appearances
They are keeping Astalos and Khezu in to help hunters finish off or upgrade weapons to get higher scores in the base defense. Othere monsters that have increased spawn rates and will also have all the bonus materials for slaying them are :
Tobi-Kadachi
Garangolm
Bazelgeuse  and the Elder Dragon is Kirin for this time. So try look at your Kirin armor and weapons and see what parts you need if you have enough health potions left over from the base defense.

What you get from these monsters is two of every material in the first two slots, hopefully rarity 6 items. Hunt-a-thons have that 10 addition materials bonus to fill up your inventory. Elder Dragons interceptions give you a bonus in the first 4 slots.

There is also a new retrofuturism pack available in the shop. IT only gives you cosmetics but you know I can't say no to the stickers! No hunting bonuses other than looking good.
