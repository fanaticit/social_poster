Don’t just swing that weapon around like you don’t know how—pack some Sonic Bombs and head into the desert.
It’s a new week in Monster Hunter Now, so what’s on the hunt list, how can you maximise your rewards, and is there something new to craft?
If you’re new to the game, this is a great opportunity to unlock a max-level weapon to help you get started.

Riftborne Diablos arrives – and with it, new gear.
This week marks the debut of Riftborne Diablos, alongside style customisation for existing weapons crafted from Diablos materials. New Diablos weapons are now available for the Sword and Shield, Great Sword, Lance, Gunlance and Heavy Bowgun.

The accompanying skill, Heroics, pairs particularly well with the Lance, Gunlance, and existing Charge Blade. These weapons allow you to absorb some damage in battle, potentially reducing your health below 29%—which then activates Heroics for a damage boost.

New playstyles for the Heavy Bowgun
Heavy Bowgun receives its own style customisation this week, offering new ways to play:
Guard Reload allows you to reload while guarding, giving you more defensive flexibility.
Crouching Shot prioritises offence, enabling you to fire more rounds than usual for sustained pressure.
There’s also a Heavy Bowgun style quest, which gives a material boost for both Diablos and Riftborne equipment—ideal for quick progression.

Several monsters are offering enhanced rewards this week, including:
Brute Tigrex
Goss Harag
Quematrice
Lunagaron
For these hunts, you’ll receive double materials in the first two reward slots and 10 additional Rarity 1 materials per defeated monster. Group hunts guarantee a second slot of monster materials, helping you gather what you need faster to craft weapons and armour.

Deviljho is appearing more frequently in volatile territories. Bazelgeuse is taking a break and will be less active this week.
For those farming Elder Dragons, Kushala Daora is the current active threat at Interception Points. EDI encounters now provide two of each material in the first four slots of basic rewards.
