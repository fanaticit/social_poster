Don't just swing that weapon around like you don't know how, pack some Sonic Bombs and let's head into the desert. It's a new week in Monster Hunter Now, what is there to hunt and how do I maximise my rewards and is there something new to build? If you are new to the game it's a good opertunity to get a max level weapon to help you get started.

It's the debut of Riftborne Diablos and the style customization for weapons we already have from Diablos materials. They are adding Sword and Shield, Great Sword, Lance, Gunlance, and Heavy Bowgun Diablos versions as well. The skill that comes with them Heroics will work well with the Lance, Gunlance and existing Charge Blade as these let you take a little damage during the fight that can take you below 29% health and activate Heroics.

Heavy Bow Gun gets their style customization as well. Guard Reload will let you reload your bowgun while in a guard state, and Crouching Shot will let you prioritizes offense, allowing you to fire more ammo than normal. Lets have fun trying out the different way to play.
There will a Heavy Bow Gun style quest to get a boost of Diablos and riftborne materials.

Other monster activity that come with bonus to their rewards are Brute Tigrex, Goss Harag, Quematrice, Lunagaron.
For these monsters you will get double the materials in the first two slots and 10 additional Rarity 1 materials from the slain monster. Group hunts give you a guaranteed second slot of monster materials.
You want these rewards as it does boost your material gathering to make those weapos and armor faster.

Also, Deviljho is going to be appearing more frequently in volatile territories. Bazelgeuse is taking a vacation. For those of you farming Elder Dragons, Kushala Daora is the active threat at Interception points, with EDIs giving you two of each material in the first to fourth slots of basic rewards.
