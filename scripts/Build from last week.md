Here is my favorite build for Mizutsune that I was using last week. I don't think I'm goign to have a build for every week as I'm sure I'll run out of ideas but lets go with it.

Wrathful Predation 10.5 The Deviljho dual blades, that I
Style Customizated to max and 3 x Affinity +10%.
I don't know if that was the best choice but I thought if I get the 30% negative affinity off then I can use it as normal dual blades as well.
This works in my build for Mizutsune.
I run Mizutsune's chest and legs to give me bubbly dance and resuscitate. I was very lucky to get two weakness exploit on my Mizutsune chest and this with the Coral Pukei hat and I have critical boost driftsmelted into the hat.
I have the deviljho belt with a dragon attack driftsmelted into it. to give me dragon attack level 3. Here is were I go crazy to put the new Malzeno gloves on to give me blood cloak and 2 more resuscitate.
It's not in the video but I spend shards to put the last point of resuscitate into the legs and I'm now playing with level 5! yes!

So interesting build to give me blood cloak for the begginning of the fight and then I pick up bubbly dance from Mizutsune's bubbles later in the fight and I have resuscitate active for almost all of the fight.
