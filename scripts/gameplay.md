Title: Maximize Vital Dragon Damage with Crimsonblood 
 
I challenged myself to finish the new Season 8 story with only the Brute Tigrex Lance. This means that each large monster has to be completed with the lance and no other weapon. It was realy fun to do and forced me to learn and change the way I fight with the lance. I'll be doing a lot more challenges like this in the future.

Here is the build and then every fight I did.

Starting with the Backbite 5 - Brute Tigrex 10-4 Lance. I have since got the last plate and upgraded it to 10-5 but while doing the story it was 10-4. Bringing lv5 Dauntless just from taking the weapon to grade 10, also bringing -10 affinity.

The helm is the Brute Tigrex bringing in Advanced Attack Boost and Reckless skills. The lance does not normally perform perfect evades, so reckless is a really good skill to have for eventually +20% damage.
I have divine blessing because I don't have a better skill diftsmelted yet.

Lagombi Chest is there to bring 3 levels of Attack Boost to get to that Advanced Attack Boost eventually, but the level 1 earplugs is what really helped me so many times during the story. The skill has been reduced to only need 3 levels so it really stops most of the screams of the monsters in the story.

The Bazelgeuse Gloves gives me two levels of Critical Ferocity taking affinity down another 15%, but giving it a chance to crit higher at 175%, and another Divine Blessing. I do thing that this can be changed but I don't have anything better yet, maybe in the next build. 

The Brute Tigrex Waist to finis off the Attack Boost and Adavnced Attack Boost and a drifsmelt of Weakness Exploit. I do need to look at this construction again as I see now that when I attack weak spots it will make the affinity still -2% in the math. So I need to either add another Weakness Exploit or replace this for something else.

Finally the incomplete Garangolm legs to finish off the Reckless and give lock on, and finally a good diftsmelted skill Fighting Spirit. I should try to make all the other slots Fighting Spirit and that will make the build solid.

So if I fix someof the diftsmelting slots I might be able to do this challenge with level 10* monsters and not just level 9*. I might still do that but first I need to have some fun with other challenges. Here are all the battles and I've put timestamps in the description so you can skill to the fights you want to see.
