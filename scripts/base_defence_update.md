Explain the fight.
It's broken up into 3 stages. Blue, Orange and Magenta. Each stage has a shield and each is 35 seconds long, so the fight is 105 seconds or 1min 45 seconds.
Each shield has a limit of 25 seconds before it needs to be destroyed. If not then the fight will end as time up.
There is no fight timer as I thing that would confuse the player as to why it ended early, this makes the fight very fun and chaotic the first few times you go in.

I've been trying to work out how much damage you need to give each shield but it changes as to the weapon you are taking in. What I can see is that feature defense weapons Astalos at 50% and Khezu plus Christmas Bow at 25% that bonus is applied when attacking the shield!
My Astalos Lance is breaking the first blue shield at 20k - 25k and my Malzeno Lance is breaking the same shield at 50k - 55k. My Khezu Hammer at 35k - 40k. Christmas Bow around 25k - 30k.

I think each shield shield is between 40k and 50k health. 

Once the shield is broken for that stage you get a damage boost of 25% for Blue stage, 50% for Orange stage and 100% for Magenta stage. Only once the shield is broken, so break it as early as you can to get more time with this damage multiplier.

There is loot after the fight. Up to 4 drops, 1 for starting the fight and an each drop for each shield broken. The loot has been really good with Rathian plates, Wyvern Gem Shards, and Wyvern Scarcestones. I got a few today so the rates must be high.

As I said in my previous videos there is not partbreaking and pursuit don't work in this fight. Valor does and well to get a super loaded to help break the next shield or pile on the damage.
The shield break does stagger the monster, and tip from (Firqin Tsabit Dzakadyana on the Monster Hunter Facebook group) saying to break it in the air, longer stagger.

Also tresholds for sleep, poison, paralysis and bleed are higher for this fight. They work but it's not as effective as in other fights.

Your goal during this fight is to get 1.6 million defense points. They will get you all the unique rewards. Also enough exchange tokens to buy the main items that you would want from the exchange hub. I spend mine on storage and armor refining parts. There are 25 up for grabs!

To get this 1.6 million you don't need to get it all with one weapon. It's your top five total scores combined. So here are a few tips to helping you get to that total.

1. Use the featured defense weapons first. There bonuses help break the shields and keep you in the fight longer. Longer you are in the fight the more damage you can do.
2. Group up, friends can help break the shield giving you more time to do more damage. Monster Hunter is always more fun with friends.
3. Use the weapon even if you don't have an amazing build for it. The Christmas bow has my second highest score and the build I have is not amazing at all.
4. We have all week to farm and try again and again to get higher scores. The more you try the better you will get at dodging the attacks and breaking the shields when it matters.
