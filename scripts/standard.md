Hunters, 2025 is almost in the books, and Niantic is kicking off 2026 with a massive global event. We are talking about the "Happy Hunting New Year 2026" celebration, and you need to play as you don't want to miss out on this event.

We’re getting two brand new event-exclusive weapons—including the first-ever Paralysis Dual Blades in the game—a Global Community Challenge that drops Wyvern Gem Shards, and a massive 50% range expansion for the second half of the event.

I’ve broken down the entire schedule and the strategy you need to farm this event effectively. Let’s dive in. First, let’s talk loot. What are we grinding for? We have two new weapons and some hilarious layered armor.

The star of the show for me is the Twin Wreathes. These are Dual Blades, and they are the first Paralysis element Dual Blades to hit Monster Hunter Now. If you love locking monsters down, this is huge. They come with Evade Extender Level 3 right out of the box, plus the Solidarity skill. For the Halloween Hat this increased the ra attack power multiplied bu the number of hunters with an extra effect during the event. Lets see what this one brings.

Next, we have the Wrapping Bow. This is a Thunder element weapon with Ballistics Level 2. Remember it’s a featured defense weapon for Base Defense. If you’re playing that mode, this bow grants bonus points. So try to max it out to use as one of the 5 weapons.

(Chuckling) And for the fashion hunters... we’re getting the Festive Tree layered equipment. Yes, you can wear a tree on your head. We’re also getting a Banbaro Christmas Sweater, and the Lagombi Sweater from last year is returning if you missed it. I feel like a model for the sweater now!

Now, how do you get this stuff? It’s tied to the Global Challenge. Starting December 22nd, the game is tracking every large monster slain by every hunter worldwide in real-time. We are all working together on this one. By completing the Global Challenge quest line, you aren’t just getting tickets to forge the Bow. You are getting 5 Wyvern Gem Shards. For free. Well, "free" as in you have to hunt, but that is a massive progression boost for F2P players or anyone stuck at the Grade 8 wall.

While you're hunting, you'll be earning Winter 2025 Exchange Tokens. You get these from slaying large monsters, Elder Dragons, and completing quests. Do not hoard these! You take them to the Event Exchange Hub to swap for that layered armor and other materials. The Hub is open until January 11th, but don't leave it to the last minute.

This is the most confusing part of the announcement, so I’ve simplified it. The event is split into two halves, and they have very different bonuses.

Part I runs from December 22nd to the 29th. During this week, you’ll see boosted spawns for Astalos, Khezu, Zinogre, Bishaten, and Tzitzi-Ya-Ku. Bonus: You get double rewards in the first and second slots for field kills.

But Part II—from December 29th to January 4th—is where things go crazy. First, the spawn list changes. We get Espinas, Rajang, Somnacanth, and Deviljho. Second, and this is massive: Access range is increased by 50% at all times.
That means you can reach nodes and monsters from much further away. On top of that, during Part II, Hunt-a-thons and Elder Dragon Interceptions are running 24 hours a day. No more waiting for the reset timer. If you’re awake at 3:00 AM, you can hunt an Elder Dragon.

Also, throughout the entire event, Monster Investigations will be increased to find Riftborne monsters. During this season we need to spend more time with others, in hunts too.

Tip: Make use of the upgrade Material Reduction, you can upgrade the Twin Wreathes and Wrapping Bow up to a certain grade using only the Event Tickets. No Zenny. No gatherable materials. Once the event ends, the cost goes back up to normal monster parts and cash. So, hunt hard, get the tickets, and push those weapons as high as you can before January 8th to save yourself a fortune.

So, to recap:
Grind the Global Challenge for those 5 Wyvern Gem Shards.
Craft the Paralysis Dual Blades—they’re going to be meta for crowd control.
Go absolutely ham during Part II (Dec 29 - Jan 4) to take advantage of the 50% range boost and 24-hour raids.

I’m really looking forward to seeing everyone rocking the Christmas Tree helmets in the lobby. Let me know in the comments: are you building the Bow or the Dual Blades first?
